        # Example structure:
        # 1. Patch 'meshtastic.serial_interface.SerialInterface' for both cli and server
        #    to use mock sendText and receive mechanisms.
        #
        # 2. Start server logic in a thread.
        #    - The server's meshtastic receive loop will get messages from cli_to_server_queue.
        #    - The server's meshtastic send function will use mock_meshtastic_sendText_server.
        #    - The server's Bitcoin RPC client needs to be self.mock_rpc_client.
        #
        # 3. Prepare CLI args (tx_hex, destination).
        #    - The CLI's meshtastic send function will use mock_meshtastic_sendText_cli.
        #    - The CLI's message receiver (injected_message_receiver) will get from server_to_cli_queue.
        #
        # 4. Run cli_main.
        #
        # 5. Assertions:
        #    - CLI returns 0.
        #    - self.mock_rpc_client.sendrawtransaction was called with correct tx.
        #    - Queues are empty eventually (or messages processed).
        #    - Correct print outputs for success from CLI.
